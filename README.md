# Simon Says Game

![Simon Says Game]

Welcome to the Simon Says game! This project is a simple web-based memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors. It's a fun way to challenge your memory skills and enjoy some retro gaming vibes.

## Features

- **Colorful Buttons**: The game includes four colored buttonsâ€”red, yellow, green, and purple.
- **Dynamic Sequences**: The computer generates a sequence of colors, and players must replicate it.
- **Levels**: As you progress, the game gets more challenging with longer sequences.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes, so you can play on desktop or mobile.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the computer's sequenceâ€”it will flash the buttons in a specific order.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
4. If you get it right, you'll advance to the next level. If not, it's game over!
